## Configure R environment
Since, Douhau Data Studio build and run based on R Shiny framework, it is necessary to install and configure the R environment.

### R installation
#### For windows users
R is obtain freely from CRAN web site.  
[https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.3-win.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.3-win.exe)  
And after to finish download, installer R-4.0.3-win.exe should be launch and to complete R installation.  
Next, user path environment for R has to be configured through the following steps.  
To check the path of installed R, "where R" command into Command Prompt is very useful. 

```{r echo=FALSE, my-fig, fig.cap="fig caption"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/RheckPathToR.png"))
``` 
``` 

This command returns complete path string, example "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.3\bin\Rscript.exe", however, the last part of "\Rscript.exe" has to be removed to cofigured as path environment variable.
